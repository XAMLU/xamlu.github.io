## One Day Workshop

In this one day course, join Jerry Nixon and Daren May, as they continue training developers and guide you and your team through modern XAML building blocks and patterns for creating your enterprise solutions. XAML is declarative presentation technology common to WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) and UWP (Universal Windows Platform). This course, while relevant to WPF, will primary focus on the innovations in UWP - the latest iteration of the XAML platform. In this course, you will learn about core patterns, fundamental controls, and techniques to control data quality and user experience. You will build a sample application exploring these concepts in a practical way. Leave with the knowledge, the sample code, and the industry relationships you can use today; get started with confidence.
